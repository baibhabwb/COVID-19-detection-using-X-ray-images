#GENERAL STEPS

1. I used X-ray images of both normal patients and patients with COVID-19.
2. Also I have used a shortened URL to upload the datasets.It may happen that the shortened url might not open,as it looks like a one time use url.
3. In that case, I have uploaded the datasets into the Dropbox( https://www.dropbox.com/s/tupyulg5c5nabxt/CovidDataset-20200427T133042Z-001.zip?dl=0 ).
4. The Dropbox url may be shortened using any onlinr URL shortener and minute changes in the first two lines of code( the dataset importing part and zip opening part ),we can get the necessary results.
